Paul drove through traffic this morning on I94 through loads of traffic.  
There was so much traffic that it was stop and go for miles and miles.
After 45 minutes of this, Paul was about to pop 3 aspirin, but instead, opted to turn on his satellite radio.
On came ESPN to Paul's delight, highlighting the plays of the Monday Night game of the Ravens and Cardinals.
Immediately, the frustration of being in traffic dissipated, momentarily.  
Of course, the scores got boring so it was time to change to another channel. 
Howard Stern was the choice and damn it was good!
Time to park the car and go to class.
