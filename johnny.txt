Little Johnny boy was walking down the screen on a chilly October afternoon. He had just finished eating lunch at Expressed Panda, his belly full of delicious food. He held a tall orange glass of soda in his hand with a bag plump with candied snacks he was saving for later.

He approached the corner of an intersection and sighed, looking both ways for incoming traffic. Seeing the coast was clear, he quickly dashed down to the other side of the street hoping nobody grew anxious to increase their speed. A half of a minute later his foot had hit the curb at the opposite end of the street, his journey across the street a miniscule victory.
