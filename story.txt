Little Johnny boy was walking down the screen on a chilly October afternoon. He had just finished eating lunch at Expressed Panda, his belly full of delicious food. He held a tall orange glass of soda in his hand with a bag plump with candied snacks he was saving for later.  The air was crisp with had a light bite to it as Fall had arrived and winter was not too far away; he knew deep down that this year would be colder than the previous year.  
He approached the corner of an intersection and sighed, looking both ways for incoming traffic. Seeing the coast was clear, he quickly dashed down to the other side of the street hoping nobody grew anxious to increase their speed. A half of a minute later his foot had hit the curb at the opposite end of the street, his journey across the street a miniscule victory.

I had been living in Los Angeles for less than 18 months when we had the conversation. Gathered at a local bar, a few of us were toasting our friend Justin (not his real name). For, you see, as of that afternoon, Justin was no longer gainfully employed. And what I thought was going to be a somber occasion turned out to be quite the opposite.

"No, not fired," Justin explained, "I quit. I just couldn't take it anymore."

Like many of us in the group, Justin had showbiz dreams. A few, like myself, wanted to be writers, but most of them, like Justin, wanted to be actors. Which is why the news was so curious.

It's a cliché, but clichés are clichés for a reason: Because they are true. While working toward his big break as an actor, Justin worked as a waiter. And because there were so many aspiring actors and actresses, waiter jobs were tough to come by. Especially ones like the one Justin had.

He worked at a very famous, very expensive restaurant. The higher end the restaurant, of course, the better, because it meant larger checks. And the more expensive the bill was, the bigger the tip was.

Mark Twain

Old inhabitants tell how, in a certain Nevada camp, the news went abroad early in the morning that a woman was come! The miners had seen a calico dress hanging out of a wagon down at the camping ground---sign of emigrants from over the great plains. Everybody went down there, and a shout went up when an actual bona fide dress was discovered fluttering in the wind! The male emigrant was visible. The miners said:

“Fetch her out!”

He said: “It’s my wife, gentlemen---she is sick---we have been robbed of money, provisions, everything, by the Indians---we want to rest.”

“Fetch her out! We’ve got to see her!”

“But gentlemen, the poor thing, she---“

“FETCH HER OUT!”

He “fetched her out,” and they swung their hats and sent up three rousing cheers, and they crowded around and gazed at her, and touched her dress, and listened to her voice with the look of men who listened to a memory rather than a present reality---and then they collected twenty-five hundreds dollars in gold and gave it to the man, and swung their hats again, and gave three more cheers, and went home satisfied.

Paul drove through traffic this morning on I94 through loads of traffic.  
There was so much traffic that it was stop and go for miles and miles.
After 45 minutes of this, Paul was about to pop 3 aspirin, but instead, opted to turn on his satellite radio.
On came ESPN to Paul's delight, highlighting the plays of the Monday Night game of the Ravens and Cardinals.
Immediately, the frustration of being in traffic dissipated, momentarily.  
Of course, the scores got boring so it was time to change to another channel. 
Howard Stern was the choice and damn it was good!
Time to park the car and go to class.

Est quidem vera lex recta ratio naturae congruens, diffusa in omnes, constans, sempiterna, quae vocet ad officium iubendo, vetando a fraude deterreat; quae tamen neque probos frustra iubet aut vetat nec improbos iubendo aut vetando movet. Huic legi nec obrogari fas est neque derogari ex hac aliquid licet neque tota abrogari potest, nec vero aut per senatum aut per populum solvi hac lege possumus, neque est quaerendus explanator aut interpres eius alius, nec erit alia lex Romae, alia Athenis, alia nunc, alia posthac, sed et omnes gentes et omni tempore una lex et sempiterna et immutabilis continebit, unusque erit communis quasi magister et imperator omnium deus, ille legis huius inventor, disceptator, lator; cui qui non parebit, ipse se fugiet ac naturam hominis aspernatus hoc ipso luet maximas poenas, etiamsi cetera supplicia, quae putantur, effugerit.
