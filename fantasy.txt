I had been living in Los Angeles for less than 18 months when we had the conversation. Gathered at a local bar, a few of us were toasting our friend Justin (not his real name). For, you see, as of that afternoon, Justin was no longer gainfully employed. And what I thought was going to be a somber occasion turned out to be quite the opposite.

"No, not fired," Justin explained, "I quit. I just couldn't take it anymore."

Like many of us in the group, Justin had showbiz dreams. A few, like myself, wanted to be writers, but most of them, like Justin, wanted to be actors. Which is why the news was so curious.

It's a cliché, but clichés are clichés for a reason: Because they are true. While working toward his big break as an actor, Justin worked as a waiter. And because there were so many aspiring actors and actresses, waiter jobs were tough to come by. Especially ones like the one Justin had.

He worked at a very famous, very expensive restaurant. The higher end the restaurant, of course, the better, because it meant larger checks. And the more expensive the bill was, the bigger the tip was.
